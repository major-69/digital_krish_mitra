    <string name="donationdesc">Sureshbhai’s name is recognised with much love and reverence by everyone in and around Bhabhar, Gujarat. For over five years now, this man has been the source of happiness and relief for thousands of people who are too poor to afford a single meal. He gives them freshly cooked meals daily and a reason to continue with their lives. But there was a time when Sureshbhai was going through a lot of trouble in his life - he wasn’t sure if he would be able to feed his own family.

    “As soon as I heard the word cancer, I went blank. I couldn’t hear the other words the doctor was saying anymore. Everything around me was a blur. I can’t explain how shocked we both were. We couldn’t believe that our Kaivalya who was playing and active just a few days ago, was now battling such a dangerous disease.” - Ujwala Bhoir, Mother  </string>
